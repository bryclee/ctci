	Given a probability P of making a shot, when is the probability of making 2/3 shots better than the probability of making a shot?

		p < (3c2) * (P^2 * (1 - P)) + P^3
		P < (3!/(2! * 1)) * (P^2 - P^3) + P^3
		P < 3P^2 - 3P^3 + P^3
		1 < -2P^2 + 3*P
		0 < -2P^2 + 3*P - 1
		0 < (2P - 1)(-P + 1) or 0 > (2P - 1)(P - 1)

	These are equal when P = 0.5. When P < 0.5, the probability of making at least 2/3 shots is greater than the probability of making one shot.
